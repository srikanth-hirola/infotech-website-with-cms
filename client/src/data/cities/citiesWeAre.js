Through a mix of digital marketing tactics, you are able to guide users through their online journey, resulting in more conversions for your business. The beauty of digital marketing is that all of the tactics work together in harmony. An effective digital marketing strategy will also reinforce your traditional marketing, providing your target audience with cohesive messaging. There are also a number of benefits to digital marketing over traditional marketing. Digital marketing is flexible. With digital, you have the ability to make changes over the course of a campaign, unlike traditional where you’re locked into long campaigns that are set in stone. Digital campaigns are also much easier to track because you can set up tracking pixels, create robust event tracking across your website and develop trackable links using utm parameters, which all tie your success directly back to specific campaigns. These pixels allow for remarketing campaigns which target users who have previously visited your website based on the actions they took."

To refine or create a digital marketing strategy, start by clearly writing down what your business goals are and agreeing on them internally. We love the SMART goal format: Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Timely. If you need some structure, check out our SMART goals template. Next, go through existing and past digital marketing efforts, and look at the data to see how strategies performed in each channel. Keep what works, and replace what doesn’t"

                "description": "A Gartner CMO survey found that publicly traded companies spend about 11% of their revenue on marketing, and up to 2/3 of that marketing budget goes to digital. But what about your company? If you’ve been doing digital marketing for a while, you may know your usual return on ad spend (ROAS), potential customer lifetime value and other ROI information. Use these to assess cost versus benefit and build your budget – because there’s no “magic percentage” of revenue to use. If you don’t have that historic data to work with, set a maximum budget you are comfortable with, and watch performance closely to adjust as needed. When deciding how to allocate budget for digital marketing versus traditional, think about your audience. Where are they consuming media the most? What ad mediums have performed well in the past? Try some new things out, test and revise."

If your target customer isn’t on a particular social media platform, then you may not need to be either. Each social media platform releases its demographic information, making it easier to see which platforms your audience likes best. Also, if you don’t have internal resources to manage a lot of social media activity, it’s better to use two platforms well than it is to use four badly. Or you can find a partner to handle your social media marketing."

That’s why this is one of the most asked marketing questions. But the truth is, great content marketing supports all your other digital marketing strategies.

For example, if your goal is to increase the number of visitors that convert to leads on your blog, then you would want to track blog sessions and resulting lead forms and/or clicks-to-call. The KPI you care about may vary based on your role in the company and who you report to."

Some companies (or single departments within) may differentiate between a website conversion – like a contact form completion – and a sales conversion, which is a successful sale that occurs after a website conversion. In our agency’s experience, companies commonly call sales-oriented website actions conversions, and they call sales, sales. However you want to talk about it, just make sure your internal team and vendors are on the same page."

For example, at Blue Compass we work with other businesses to produce stellar digital marketing campaigns.

Through a mix of digital marketing tactics, you are able to guide users through their online journey, resulting in more conversions for your business. The beauty of digital marketing is that all of the tactics work together in harmony. An effective digital marketing strategy will also reinforce your traditional marketing, providing your target audience with cohesive messaging. There are also a number of benefits to digital marketing over traditional marketing. Digital marketing is flexible. With digital, you have the ability to make changes over the course of a campaign, unlike traditional where you’re locked into long campaigns that are set in stone. Digital campaigns are also much easier to track because you can set up tracking pixels, create robust event tracking across your website and develop trackable links using utm parameters, which all tie your success directly back to specific campaigns. These pixels allow for remarketing campaigns which target users who have previously visited your website based on the actions they took."

To refine or create a digital marketing strategy, start by clearly writing down what your business goals are and agreeing on them internally. We love the SMART goal format: Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Timely. If you need some structure, check out our SMART goals template. Next, go through existing and past digital marketing efforts, and look at the data to see how strategies performed in each channel. Keep what works, and replace what doesn’t"

                "description": "A Gartner CMO survey found that publicly traded companies spend about 11% of their revenue on marketing, and up to 2/3 of that marketing budget goes to digital. But what about your company? If you’ve been doing digital marketing for a while, you may know your usual return on ad spend (ROAS), potential customer lifetime value and other ROI information. Use these to assess cost versus benefit and build your budget – because there’s no “magic percentage” of revenue to use. If you don’t have that historic data to work with, set a maximum budget you are comfortable with, and watch performance closely to adjust as needed. When deciding how to allocate budget for digital marketing versus traditional, think about your audience. Where are they consuming media the most? What ad mediums have performed well in the past? Try some new things out, test and revise."

If your target customer isn’t on a particular social media platform, then you may not need to be either. Each social media platform releases its demographic information, making it easier to see which platforms your audience likes best. Also, if you don’t have internal resources to manage a lot of social media activity, it’s better to use two platforms well than it is to use four badly. Or you can find a partner to handle your social media marketing."

That’s why this is one of the most asked marketing questions. But the truth is, great content marketing supports all your other digital marketing strategies. For example, when you align your content and SEO strategy with PPC (using our sexy swivel table!), you can unlock major benefits in both organic and paid media channels."

For example, if your goal is to increase the number of visitors that convert to leads on your blog, then you would want to track blog sessions and resulting lead forms and/or clicks-to-call. The KPI you care about may vary based on your role in the company and who you report to."

Some companies (or single departments within) may differentiate between a website conversion – like a contact form completion – and a sales conversion, which is a successful sale that occurs after a website conversion. In our agency’s experience, companies commonly call sales-oriented website actions conversions, and they call sales, sales. However you want to talk about it, just make sure your internal team and vendors are on the same page."

But what about your company? If you’ve been doing digital marketing for a while, you may know your usual return on ad spend (ROAS), potential customer lifetime value and other ROI information. Use these to assess cost versus benefit and build your budget – because there’s no “magic percentage” of revenue to use. If you don’t have that historic data to work with, set a maximum budget you are comfortable with, and watch performance closely to adjust as needed. When deciding how to allocate budget for digital marketing versus traditional, think about your audience. Where are they consuming media the most? What ad mediums have performed well in the past?

If your target customer isn’t on a particular social media platform, then you may not need to be either. Each social media platform releases its demographic information, making it easier to see which platforms your audience likes best. Also, if you don’t have internal resources to manage a lot of social media activity, it’s better to use two platforms well than it is to use four badly. Or you can find a partner to handle your social media marketing."

That’s why this is one of the most asked marketing questions. But the truth is, great content marketing supports all your other digital marketing strategies. For example, when you align your content and SEO strategy with PPC (using our sexy swivel table!), you can unlock major benefits in both organic and paid media channels."

For example, if your goal is to increase the number of visitors that convert to leads on your blog, then you would want to track blog sessions and resulting lead forms and/or clicks-to-call. The KPI you care about may vary based on your role in the company and who you report to."

Some companies (or single departments within) may differentiate between a website conversion – like a contact form completion – and a sales conversion, which is a successful sale that occurs after a website conversion. In our agency’s experience, companies commonly call sales-oriented website actions conversions, and they call sales, sales. However you want to talk about it, just make sure your internal team and vendors are on the same page."

The beauty of digital marketing is that all of the tactics work together in harmony. An effective digital marketing strategy will also reinforce your traditional marketing, providing your target audience with cohesive messaging. There are also a number of benefits to digital marketing over traditional marketing. Digital marketing is flexible. With digital, you have the ability to make changes over the course of a campaign, unlike traditional where you’re locked into long campaigns that are set in stone. Digital campaigns are also much easier to track because you can set up tracking pixels, create robust event tracking across your website and develop trackable links using utm parameters, which all tie your success directly back to specific campaigns. These pixels allow for remarketing campaigns which target users who have previously visited your website based on the actions they took."

But what about your company? If you’ve been doing digital marketing for a while, you may know your usual return on ad spend (ROAS), potential customer lifetime value and other ROI information. Use these to assess cost versus benefit and build your budget – because there’s no “magic percentage” of revenue to use. If you don’t have that historic data to work with, set a maximum budget you are comfortable with, and watch performance closely to adjust as needed. When deciding how to allocate budget for digital marketing versus traditional, think about your audience. Where are they consuming media the most? What ad mediums have performed well in the past? Try some new things out, test and revise."

Each social media platform releases its demographic information, making it easier to see which platforms your audience likes best. Also, if you don’t have internal resources to manage a lot of social media activity, it’s better to use two platforms well than it is to use four badly.

For example, at Blue Compass we work with other businesses to produce stellar digital marketing campaigns.

Through a mix of digital marketing tactics, you are able to guide users through their online journey, resulting in more conversions for your business. The beauty of digital marketing is that all of the tactics work together in harmony. An effective digital marketing strategy will also reinforce your traditional marketing, providing your target audience with cohesive messaging. There are also a number of benefits to digital marketing over traditional marketing. Digital marketing is flexible. With digital, you have the ability to make changes over the course of a campaign, unlike traditional where you’re locked into long campaigns that are set in stone. Digital campaigns are also much easier to track because you can set up tracking pixels, create robust event tracking across your website and develop trackable links using utm parameters, which all tie your success directly back to specific campaigns. These pixels allow for remarketing campaigns which target users who have previously visited your website based on the actions they took."

To refine or create a digital marketing strategy, start by clearly writing down what your business goals are and agreeing on them internally. We love the SMART goal format: Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Timely. If you need some structure, check out our SMART goals template. Next, go through existing and past digital marketing efforts, and look at the data to see how strategies performed in each channel. Keep what works, and replace what doesn’t"

                "description": "A Gartner CMO survey found that publicly traded companies spend about 11% of their revenue on marketing, and up to 2/3 of that marketing budget goes to digital. But what about your company? If you’ve been doing digital marketing for a while, you may know your usual return on ad spend (ROAS), potential customer lifetime value and other ROI information. Use these to assess cost versus benefit and build your budget – because there’s no “magic percentage” of revenue to use. If you don’t have that historic data to work with, set a maximum budget you are comfortable with, and watch performance closely to adjust as needed. When deciding how to allocate budget for digital marketing versus traditional, think about your audience. Where are they consuming media the most? What ad mediums have performed well in the past? Try some new things out, test and revise."

If your target customer isn’t on a particular social media platform, then you may not need to be either. Each social media platform releases its demographic information, making it easier to see which platforms your audience likes best. Also, if you don’t have internal resources to manage a lot of social media activity, it’s better to use two platforms well than it is to use four badly. Or you can find a partner to handle your social media marketing."

That’s why this is one of the most asked marketing questions. But the truth is, great content marketing supports all your other digital marketing strategies. For example, when you align your content and SEO strategy with PPC (using our sexy swivel table!), you can unlock major benefits in both organic and paid media channels."

For example, if your goal is to increase the number of visitors that convert to leads on your blog, then you would want to track blog sessions and resulting lead forms and/or clicks-to-call. The KPI you care about may vary based on your role in the company and who you report to."

Some companies (or single departments within) may differentiate between a website conversion – like a contact form completion – and a sales conversion, which is a successful sale that occurs after a website conversion. In our agency’s experience, companies commonly call sales-oriented website actions conversions, and they call sales, sales. However you want to talk about it, just make sure your internal team and vendors are on the same page."

Through a mix of digital marketing tactics, you are able to guide users through their online journey, resulting in more conversions for your business. The beauty of digital marketing is that all of the tactics work together in harmony. An effective digital marketing strategy will also reinforce your traditional marketing, providing your target audience with cohesive messaging. There are also a number of benefits to digital marketing over traditional marketing. Digital marketing is flexible. With digital, you have the ability to make changes over the course of a campaign, unlike traditional where you’re locked into long campaigns that are set in stone. Digital campaigns are also much easier to track because you can set up tracking pixels, create robust event tracking across your website and develop trackable links using utm parameters, which all tie your success directly back to specific campaigns. These pixels allow for remarketing campaigns which target users who have previously visited your website based on the actions they took."

We love the SMART goal format: Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Timely. If you need some structure, check out our SMART goals template. Next, go through existing and past digital marketing efforts, and look at the data to see how strategies performed in each channel. Keep what works, and replace what doesn’t"

                "description": "A Gartner CMO survey found that publicly traded companies spend about 11% of their revenue on marketing, and up to 2/3 of that marketing budget goes to digital. But what about your company? If you’ve been doing digital marketing for a while, you may know your usual return on ad spend (ROAS), potential customer lifetime value and other ROI information. Use these to assess cost versus benefit and build your budget – because there’s no “magic percentage” of revenue to use. If you don’t have that historic data to work with, set a maximum budget you are comfortable with, and watch performance closely to adjust as needed. When deciding how to allocate budget for digital marketing versus traditional, think about your audience. Where are they consuming media the most? What ad mediums have performed well in the past? Try some new things out, test and revise."

Each social media platform releases its demographic information, making it easier to see which platforms your audience likes best. Also, if you don’t have internal resources to manage a lot of social media activity, it’s better to use two platforms well than it is to use four badly. Or you can find a partner to handle your social media marketing."

There are also a number of benefits to digital marketing over traditional marketing. Digital marketing is flexible. With digital, you have the ability to make changes over the course of a campaign, unlike traditional where you’re locked into long campaigns that are set in stone. Digital campaigns are also much easier to track because you can set up tracking pixels, create robust event tracking across your website and develop trackable links using utm parameters, which all tie your success directly back to specific campaigns. These pixels allow for remarketing campaigns which target users who have previously visited your website based on the actions they took."

But what about your company? If you’ve been doing digital marketing for a while, you may know your usual return on ad spend (ROAS), potential customer lifetime value and other ROI information. Use these to assess cost versus benefit and build your budget – because there’s no “magic percentage” of revenue to use. If you don’t have that historic data to work with, set a maximum budget you are comfortable with, and watch performance closely to adjust as needed. When deciding how to allocate budget for digital marketing versus traditional, think about your audience. Where are they consuming media the most? What ad mediums have performed well in the past?

For example, if your goal is to increase the number of visitors that convert to leads on your blog, then you would want to track blog sessions and resulting lead forms and/or clicks-to-call. The KPI you care about may vary based on your role in the company and who you report to."

Some companies (or single departments within) may differentiate between a website conversion – like a contact form completion – and a sales conversion, which is a successful sale that occurs after a website conversion. In our agency’s experience, companies commonly call sales-oriented website actions conversions, and they call sales, sales. However you want to talk about it, just make sure your internal team and vendors are on the same page."
